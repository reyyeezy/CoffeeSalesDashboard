# Coffee Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

## Introduction
In this project, we take on the role of a data analyst for a Coffee Distributor. We use Excel to analyze coffee sales from a data set and provide business insights.

We are challenged to:
* Understand the data
* Provide sales insights, understanding customer purchasing patterns
* Propose any data-driven action to optimize the results of any marketing campaigns and generate value for the company

## Filtering and Sorting Our Data
Our data was separated into 3 different sheets including; orders, customers, and product information. We use various excel functions including
XLOOKUP and  INDEXMATCH to bring data from different sheets into one to then create a pivot table. Other excel functions used in preparing the dataset included; Multiple IF functions, Date Formatting, and Number formatting.

## Summarizing Our Data
Some key insights from analysis:
* United States is the highest purchasing country by over $28,000.
* Out of the top 5 spenders, 4 do not have a loyalty card.
* The larger the size of coffee a customer purchases, the more they tend to spend.
